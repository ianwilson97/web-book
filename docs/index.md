![boy learning](https://i.postimg.cc/hPDbND70/temp-Image-Q189-WF.avif)

As a software engineer, I created this handbook to serve as my own personal "second brain" - a living repository of knowledge, experiences, and learning that will go with me throughout my career. While others may find value in this documentation, its primary purpose is to help me grow and excel in my software engineering journey.

## Why I Created This Handbook 
The inspiration for this handbook came from a common challenge I faced, that I also feel others continuously face as well: the need to constantly revisit, relearn, and recall various aspects of software engineering. I found myself:

- Repeatedly searching for solutions I had previously implemented
- Needing a reliable way to document my learning experiences
- Wanting to track my growth and evolution as a developer
- Desiring a structured way to build upon my knowledge

This handbook serves as my personal knowledge management system, helping me maintain and expand my expertise while reducing cognitive load.

## Structure of My Knowledge Base
I've organized this handbook to reflect the key areas of my software engineering practice:

🔮 **Fundamentals**

Core concepts I need to maintain and regularly revisit, including programming principles, data structures, and algorithms.

💻 **Programming Languages**

Documentation of my experience with Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, Go, Rust, and C/C++:

- Language-specific patterns that I frequently use
- Solutions to common challenges
- Language-specific syntax overviews of each for review
- Personal coding preferences and style notes
- Tips and tricks to remember

🛠 **Tools and Technologies**
My setup and configurations for:

- Version control workflows
- IDE customizations
- Debugging approaches
- Container configurations

📐 **Architecture and Design**

Time tested insights, personal experiences, and learnings with:

- Design patterns
- Microservices architecture
- Tradoffs between different architectural approaches

💾 **Database Systems**

My learnings, readings, and knowledge of:

- SQL and NoSQL as well as their various implementations
- ORM configurations
- Database design decisions and their outcomes

🚀 **DevOps and Deployment**

Here will be documentation of my preferred:

- CI/CD pipeline setups
- Monitoring solutions
- Cloud service configurations

📋 **Project Management**

Here you'll find my notes and learnings on process improvements and team collaboration.

👨‍💻 **Professional Development**

Here is where you'll find tracking my career growth through:

- My own growth in personal coding standards and skill
- Code review insights that I receive as I gain in seniority
- Learning resources that I find valuable as time goes on
