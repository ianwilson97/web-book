## Data Structures, Algorithms, and Patterns

### Introduction

Success in technical interviews requires a strategic, data-driven approach to preparation. This comprehensive guide provides a structured roadmap for mastering the most frequently tested concepts and patterns in coding interviews, helping you optimize your preparation time for maximum impact.

### Getting Started

Our preparation methodology focuses on high-return-on-investment (ROI) topics based on extensive analysis of interview patterns across major technology companies. By concentrating on the most commonly tested concepts, you can develop a strong foundation that translates directly to interview success.

### Overview

Technical interviews consistently evaluate candidates' proficiency in core computer science fundamentals through coding challenges. Understanding the underlying patterns in these challenges allows you to develop reusable problem-solving strategies rather than memorizing individual solutions.

### Key Focus Areas
![Top Patterns](https://i.postimg.cc/pTn3d1Xd/temp-Imagen-Zq-In-B.avif)

#### Essential Patterns

The data reveals that three fundamental patterns appear most frequently in coding interviews:

**Depth-First Search (DFS)** serves as a versatile problem-solving approach, effectively addressing challenges involving trees, graphs, and combinatorial problems. Its widespread applicability makes it an essential technique to master.

**Breadth-First Search (BFS)** consistently appears in problems requiring level-wise traversal or finding shortest paths in unweighted graphs. Understanding BFS implementation and its common variations provides significant advantages in interviews.

**Two-Pointer** techniques frequently arise in array manipulation and string processing problems. Mastering this pattern enables efficient solutions to problems involving sliding windows, palindromes, and element matching.

#### Foundational Data Structures

Core data structures form the building blocks of efficient solutions:

**Arrays**, **Linked Lists**, **Hash Maps**, **Stacks**, and **Queues** represent fundamental concepts that appear regularly in interviews. While these topics may seem basic, their mastery is crucial as they often combine with advanced patterns to solve complex problems.

#### Advanced Topics

**Priority Queues** and **Heaps** appear more frequently than commonly expected, particularly in problems involving streaming data or maintaining ordered elements. Understanding these data structures provides advantages in specific interview scenarios.

**Dynamic Programming** and **Greedy Algorithms**, while important, require significant preparation time relative to their frequency in interviews. Focus on these areas after mastering the core patterns, unless interviewing with companies known to emphasize these topics.

## Data Structures

### Stacks
![Stack](https://i.postimg.cc/Zq8wQjj0/temp-Imageq-Xcc-Jw.avif)

A stack is one of the most fundamental data structures in computer science. It follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the last element added is the first one to be removed.

#### Basic Operations

##### Push

-   Adds an element to the top of the stack
-   Think of it like placing a plate on top of a stack of plates
```python title="stack.py" linenums="1"
def push(self, item):
    if len(self.stack) >= self.limit:
        raise StackOverflowError
    self.stack.append(item)
```
##### Pop

-   Removes and returns the top element from the stack
-   Like taking the topmost plate off a stack of plates
```python title="stack.py" linenums="1"
def pop(self):
    if not self.stack:
        raise StackUnderflowError
    return self.stack.pop()
```
##### Peek (or Top)

-   Returns the top element without removing it
-   Like looking at the top plate without taking it off
```python title="stack.py" linenums="1"
def peek(self):
    if not self.stack:
        raise StackUnderflowError
    return self.stack[-1]
```

#### Common Properties

##### Empty Check
```python title="stack.py" linenums="1"
def is_empty(self):
    return len(self.stack) == 0
```
##### Full Check
```python title="stack.py" linenums="1"
def is_full(self):
    return len(self.stack) == self.limit
```

#### Common Use Cases

1.  Function call stack (managing program execution)
2.  Undo operations in text editors
3.  Browser history (back button functionality)
4.  Expression evaluation in calculators
5.  Backtracking algorithms

#### Implementation Example
```python title="stack.py" linenums="1"
class Stack:
    def __init__(self, limit=10):
        self.stack = []
        self.limit = limit
    
    def push(self, item):
        if len(self.stack) >= self.limit:
            raise StackOverflowError
        self.stack.append(item)
    
    def pop(self):
        if not self.stack:
            raise StackUnderflowError
        return self.stack.pop()
    
    def peek(self):
        if not self.stack:
            raise StackUnderflowError
        return self.stack[-1]
    
    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.stack) == 0
```

### Queues

![Queues](https://i.postimg.cc/DZBKb1Wp/temp-Image-Er-OH4-J.avif)

A queue is a fundamental data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, meaning the first element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a line of people waiting - the first person to join the line is the first to be served.

#### Basic Operations

##### Enqueue (Put)

-   Adds an element to the back of the queue
-   Like a person joining the end of a line
```python title="queue.py" linenums="1"
def put(self, item):
    self.queue.append(item)
```

##### Dequeue (Get)

-   Removes and returns the front element from the queue
-   Like the first person in line being served and leaving
```python title="queue.py" linenums="1"
def get(self):
    if not self.queue:
        raise IndexError("Queue is empty")
    return self.queue.pop(0)
```

##### Peek (Front)

-   Returns the front element without removing it
-   Like checking who's first in line without serving them
```python title="queue.py" linenums="1"
def get_front(self):
    if not self.queue:
        raise IndexError("Queue is empty")
    return self.queue[0]
```
#### Common Properties

##### Length Check
```python title="queue.py" linenums="1"
def __len__(self):
    return len(self.queue)
```

##### Is Empty
```python title="queue.py" linenums="1"
def is_empty(self):
    return len(self.queue) == 0
```

#### Implementation Example

Here's a simple implementation of a queue:
```python title="queue.py" linenums="1"
class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.queue = []
    
    def put(self, item):
        self.queue.append(item)
    
    def get(self):
        if not self.queue:
            raise IndexError("Queue is empty")
        return self.queue.pop(0)
    
    def get_front(self):
        if not self.queue:
            raise IndexError("Queue is empty")
        return self.queue[0]
    
    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.queue) == 0
```

#### Common Use Cases

1.  Print job scheduling in printers
2.  Process scheduling in operating systems
3.  Breadth-first search in graphs
4.  Customer service systems
5.  Message buffers in communication systems

#### Important Notes

1.  Unlike stacks, queues process elements in the order they were added
2.  The internal list implementation shown here is simple but not optimal for large queues (due to pop(0) being O(n))
3.  Python's  `collections.deque`  is more efficient for real-world applications
4.  Queues can have variations like priority queues or circular queues

### Singly Linked List

![Singly Linked List](https://i.postimg.cc/Bt9x0PqN/temp-Imager77kla.avif)

A singly linked list works like a chain, where each link (node) points to the next link. Think of it as a train where each car (node) is connected to the next car in line. Let me explain each key operation in simple terms.

#### Basic Structure

##### Node
```python title="list.py" linenums="1"
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data  # Stores the actual value
        self.next = None  # Points to the next node, like a pointer to the next train car
```

#### Core Operations

##### Insert at Beginning (Head)
```python title="list.py" linenums="1"
def insert_head(self, data):
    new_node = Node(data)
    new_node.next = self.head  # New node points to current first node
    self.head = new_node      # Make new node the first node
```
Think of this as adding a new car to the front of the train. The new car needs to be hooked up to the existing front car, then becomes the new front of the train.

##### Insert at End (Tail)
```python title="list.py" linenums="1"
def insert_tail(self, data):
    new_node = Node(data)
    if not self.head:         # If list is empty
        self.head = new_node  # New node becomes the head
        return
    
    current = self.head       # Start at the front
    while current.next:       # Walk to the end
        current = current.next
    current.next = new_node   # Add new node at the end
```
Like adding a new car to the end of the train. We need to walk all the way to the last car first, then attach our new car to it.

##### Insert at Index
```python title="list.py" linenums="1"
def insert_nth(self, index, data):
    new_node = Node(data)
    if index == 0:                # If inserting at front
        new_node.next = self.head # Do the same as insert_head
        self.head = new_node
        return
        
    current = self.head           # Start at front
    for _ in range(index - 1):    # Walk to position just before index
        current = current.next
    
    new_node.next = current.next  # New node points to next node
    current.next = new_node       # Previous node points to new node
```
Imagine adding a train car in the middle of the train. You need to walk to the right spot, unhook the connection there, and insert the new car by connecting it on both sides.

##### Delete from Beginning
```python title="list.py" linenums="1"
def delete_head(self):
    if not self.head:          # If list is empty, can't delete
        raise IndexError("List is empty")
    data = self.head.data      # Remember the value we're removing
    self.head = self.head.next # Second node becomes the new head
    return data                # Return removed value
```
Like removing the first car of the train. You just need to make the second car the new front of the train.

##### Delete at Index
```python title="list.py" linenums="1"
def delete_nth(self, index):
    if index == 0:             # If deleting first node
        data = self.head.data  # Do the same as delete_head
        self.head = self.head.next
        return data
        
    current = self.head        # Start at front
    for _ in range(index - 1): # Walk to node just before the one to delete
        current = current.next
        
    data = current.next.data   # Remember value being removed
    current.next = current.next.next  # Skip over the removed node
    return data
```
Similar to removing a car from the middle of the train. Walk to the spot just before it, then reconnect the cars on either side, bypassing the car you're removing.

### Doubly Linked List

![Doubly Linked List](https://i.postimg.cc/k4R01LD8/temp-Image-WX0-SJS.avif)

A doubly linked list is like a chain that can be traversed in both directions. Unlike its simpler cousin, the singly linked list, each node in a doubly linked list maintains connections to both its previous and next neighbors. This bidirectional connection provides more flexibility but requires more memory and careful management of connections.

#### Basic Structure

Let's start with the fundamental building block - the Node:
```python title="doubly_list.py" linenums="1"
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data       # The actual value stored
        self.previous = None   # Link to the previous node
        self.next = None       # Link to the next node
```
Think of each node as a train car that has two hooks - one connecting to the car in front (previous) and one connecting to the car behind (next). This dual connection is what makes it "doubly" linked.

#### Core Operations

##### Insert at Beginning (Head)
```python title="doubly_list.py" linenums="1"
def insert_at_head(self, data):
    new_node = Node(data)
    if not self.head:                    # If list is empty
        self.head = self.tail = new_node # New node becomes both head and tail
    else:
        new_node.next = self.head        # New node points forward to current head
        self.head.previous = new_node    # Current head points back to new node
        self.head = new_node             # New node becomes the head
```
This is like adding a new car to the front of a train. We need to connect it to the existing front car in both directions.

##### Insert at End (Tail)
```python title="doubly_list.py" linenums="1"
def insert_at_tail(self, data):
    new_node = Node(data)
    if not self.head:                    # If list is empty
        self.head = self.tail = new_node # New node becomes both head and tail
    else:
        self.tail.next = new_node        # Current tail points forward to new node
        new_node.previous = self.tail     # New node points back to current tail
        self.tail = new_node             # New node becomes the tail
```
Similar to adding a car at the end of the train, but we can do it efficiently since we maintain a direct reference to the tail.

##### Insert at Index
```python title="doubly_list.py" linenums="1"
def insert_at_nth(self, index, data):
    if index == 0:                      # Inserting at head
        self.insert_at_head(data)
    elif index == len(self):            # Inserting at tail
        self.insert_at_tail(data)
    else:
        current = self.head
        for _ in range(index):          # Walk to insertion point
            current = current.next
            
        new_node = Node(data)           # Create new node
        new_node.previous = current.previous  # Connect new node to previous node
        new_node.next = current              # Connect new node to next node
        current.previous.next = new_node     # Connect previous node to new node
        current.previous = new_node          # Connect next node to new node
```
When inserting in the middle, we need to carefully update four connections (two in each direction) to maintain the chain's integrity.

##### Delete Operations

The delete operations mirror their insert counterparts but focus on removing connections rather than creating them. When deleting a node, we need to reconnect its neighbors to each other, bypassing the removed node:
```python title="doubly_list.py" linenums="1"
def delete_node(self, node):
    if node == self.head:               # Deleting head
        self.head = node.next
        if self.head:
            self.head.previous = None
    else:
        node.previous.next = node.next   # Connect previous node to next node
        if node.next:                    # If not deleting tail
            node.next.previous = node.previous
```
#### Advantages and Use Cases

Doubly linked lists are particularly useful when you need to:

1.  Traverse data in both directions (like a browser's back/forward history)
2.  Delete nodes when you only have a reference to the node itself
3.  Quickly add or remove elements from either end (like in a deque)
4.  Maintain a history with undo/redo capabilities

The trade-off is that doubly linked lists use more memory than singly linked lists due to the extra previous pointer, and operations need to manage more connections. However, this extra complexity often pays off in terms of flexibility and functionality.

### Circular Singly Linked List

![Circular](https://i.postimg.cc/43MJpRCK/temp-Imager-Of-WJq.avif)

A circular linked list is a variation of a linked list where the last node points back to the first node, creating a circle. Think of it like a ring where you can keep going around and never reach an end.

#### Basic Structure

##### Node
```python title="circular.py" linenums="1"
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None  # Points to next node in circle
```

##### List Structure
```python title="circular.py" linenums="1"
class CircularLinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None  # First node
        self.tail = None  # Last node (points to head)
```

#### Core Operations

##### Insert at Front

Adds a new node at the start of the circle:
```python title="circular.py" linenums="1"
def insert_head(self, data):
    new_node = Node(data)
    if not self.head:
        # First node points to itself
        new_node.next = new_node
        self.head = self.tail = new_node
    else:
        # Connect new node to form circle
        new_node.next = self.head
        self.head = new_node
        self.tail.next = self.head
```

##### Insert at End

Adds a new node while maintaining the circle:
```python title="circular.py" linenums="1"
def insert_tail(self, data):
    new_node = Node(data)
    if not self.head:
        # First node points to itself
        new_node.next = new_node
        self.head = self.tail = new_node
    else:
        # Add to end and complete circle
        new_node.next = self.head
        self.tail.next = new_node
        self.tail = new_node
```

##### Insert at Index

Adds a node at any position in the circle:
```python title="circular.py" linenums="1" hl_lines="7 23 24"
def insert_at(self, index, data):
    if index < 0:
        raise IndexError("Index cannot be negative")
        
    # Insert at start
    if index == 0:
        self.insert_head(data)
        return
        
    # Create new node
    new_node = Node(data)
    current = self.head
    
    # Walk to insertion point
    for _ in range(index - 1):
        if current is None:
            raise IndexError("Index out of range")
        current = current.next
        if current == self.head:  # We've gone full circle
            raise IndexError("Index out of range")
            
    # Insert the node
    new_node.next = current.next
    current.next = new_node
    
    # Update tail if inserting at end
    if current == self.tail:
        self.tail = new_node
```

##### Delete from Front

Removes the first node while keeping the circle intact:
```python title="circular.py" linenums="1" hl_lines="7 9 10"
def delete_head(self):
    if not self.head:
        raise ValueError("List is empty")
        
    data = self.head.data
    if self.head == self.tail:
        self.head = self.tail = None
    else:
        self.head = self.head.next
        self.tail.next = self.head
    return data
```

##### Delete from End

Removes the last node and reconnects the circle:
```python title="circular.py" linenums="1" hl_lines="7 12 13"
def delete_tail(self):
    if not self.head:
        raise ValueError("List is empty")
        
    data = self.tail.data
    if self.head == self.tail:
        self.head = self.tail = None
    else:
        current = self.head
        while current.next != self.tail:
            current = current.next
        current.next = self.head
        self.tail = current
    return data
```

##### Delete at Index

Removes a node from any position while maintaining the circle:
```python title="circular.py" linenums="1" hl_lines="9 25"
def delete_at(self, index):
    if not self.head:
        raise IndexError("List is empty")
    if index < 0:
        raise IndexError("Index cannot be negative")
        
    # Delete from start
    if index == 0:
        return self.delete_head()
        
    # Walk to node just before deletion point
    current = self.head
    for _ in range(index - 1):
        current = current.next
        if current == self.head:  # We've gone full circle
            raise IndexError("Index out of range")
            
    # Get node to delete
    to_delete = current.next
    if to_delete == self.head:  # We've gone full circle
        raise IndexError("Index out of range")
        
    # Save data and remove node
    data = to_delete.data
    current.next = to_delete.next
    
    # Update tail if deleting last node
    if to_delete == self.tail:
        self.tail = current
        
    return data
```

#### Common Use Cases

1.  Round-robin scheduling
