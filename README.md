# Web-Book: My Software Engineering Journey

Welcome to my **Web-Book** repository! üéì This project serves as a comprehensive collection of all the knowledge I've acquired throughout my journey as a computer science student and aspiring software engineer. The web-book is a living document that consolidates the lessons I've learned both in school and through independent exploration.
